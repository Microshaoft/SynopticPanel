# Synoptic Panel for Power BI

Synoptic Panel by OKViz allows you to present one or more images (called maps, not necessarily geographical maps), assigning a meaning to arbitrary parts of them (called areas). You can highlight and color these areas dynamically and display several information over them. To design maps you can use a vector graphic editor or Synoptic Designer, a companion web tool located at https://synoptic.design/
